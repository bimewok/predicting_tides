# Predicting Tides with Machine Learning and Statistics

The Notebook in this repo contains a comparison of several different forecasting models to try to predict future tide height.
While this may seem like a very simple problem, it is actually much more complex and site-specific than one might expect, and
this provides a nice test dataset to play around with differewnt model architectures. The project used Python, Tensorflow and Statsmodels.

The project includes the following models:
-CNN
-LSTM
-XG Boost
-Autoregression
-Fully Connected Dense

Information about the environment used to run the models is in the included environment.yml

Information about the data is in the Jupyter Notebook
